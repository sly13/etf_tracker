      "howOften": "How often is {indexName} index updated?",
      "difference": "How does {indexName} index differ from Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index?",

      "forecast": "Can {indexName} index be used to forecast {assetName} price?"
    },
    "answers": {
      "whatIs": "{indexName} index (CryptoETF Flows Index) is an indicator that reflects the direction and intensity of capital flows into spot cryptocurrency ETF funds investing in {assetName}. The index is calculated based on data on inflows and outflows from major ETF funds such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitwise and others. The index value ranges from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate strong capital inflow (greed), and lower values indicate outflow (fear).",
      "howInterpret": "{indexName} index value is interpreted as follows: 0-20 - Extreme Fear, 20-40 - Fear, 40-60 - Neutral, 60-80 - Greed, 80-100 - Extreme Greed. High values usually indicate investor optimism and active capital inflow into ETF funds, while low values may signal pessimism and capital outflow.",
      "howOften": "{indexName} index is updated daily based on current ETF flow data. Data is collected from public sources and processed in real time, allowing investors to get the latest information on market sentiment and capital movement directions in cryptocurrency ETFs.",
      "difference": "Unlike the traditional Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which is based on volatility, trading volumes and social signals, {indexName} index focuses exclusively on real capital flows into institutional ETF funds. This makes it a more accurate indicator of large investor sentiment and institutional capital, which significantly affects {assetName} price.",
      "howUse": "{indexName} index can serve as an additional tool for market analysis. Extreme values (Extreme Fear or Extreme Greed) may indicate potential market reversal points. However, it is important to remember that the index is not a guarantee of future price movements and should be used in combination with other technical and fundamental analysis methods. Always do your own research before making investment decisions.",
      "whichFunds": "When calculating {indexName} index, data from the largest spot cryptocurrency ETF funds is considered, including BlackRock (IBIT), Fidelity (FBTC), Bitwise (BITB), ARK 21Shares (ARKB), VanEck (HODL), Invesco (BTCO), Grayscale (GBTC) and others. The index aggregates capital flows from all these funds, providing a comprehensive picture of institutional sentiment in the {assetName} market.",
      "composite": "CEFI-Composite index is an aggregated indicator that combines data on capital flows into ETF funds for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana. This index provides a general overview of investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market as a whole, showing the overall direction of institutional capital movement between different cryptocurrency assets.",
      "forecast": "{indexName} index reflects current investor sentiment and capital flows, but is not a direct price forecasting tool. Strong capital inflow into ETF funds may indicate growing interest in {assetName}, which could potentially support the price, but many other factors also affect price dynamics. The index is better used as an indicator of current market sentiment rather than as the sole forecasting tool."
